> *Ancient Era Tech*

## Purpose

For far too long the ancient genre has not been able to come to widespread adoption of a new technology. We believe this is because new ancient genre technologies contain some of the following:

1. a lack of customizability
2. a hard to learn combat system 
3. or a lack of combat depth 
3. not being open sourced

AET plans to change this by introducing a combat system which has almost no initial learning curve yet retains depth and is open sourced and easily customizable. Below you'll find some of planned features which we hope will set apart this system from others and lead it to widespread adoption.
