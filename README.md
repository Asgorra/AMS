# Advanced Melee System

## What?
Advanced Melee System is an open source skill-based combat technology which aims to be customizable.

## Who?
Advanced Melee System is designed to be used in any genre that uses medieval-like weapons (swords, spears, shields, bows), so it would be suitable for Ancient, Medieval, and even Sci-Fi games (like star wars and dune which use sword-like weapons).

## What features does AMS have?

### Tools
AMS has most of the tools you would need for a melee combat system. It has swords, shields, spears/javelins, and bows.

### Directional System
AMS utilizes a directional system, meaning you can swing in 4 different directions and block in 4 different directions when using only a weapon.

### Draw System
AMS utilizes a draw system, meaning you can draw your weapon out by holding left click to deal more damage. Damages range from 20-40.

### Feint System
AMS utilizes a feint system. To feint you must right click while your weapon is still being drawn. This will cancel your attack and possibly trick your opponent.

### Stun System
AMS utilizes a stun system. There are two types of stuns, a block stun and a hit stun. A __Hit Stun__ is given upon hitting a player. If you hit a player who is swinging / drawing their weapon, you will cancel their attack. They are then stunned for 0.3 seconds in which they cannot attack again. A __Block Stun__ is given upon blocking a player. By blocking a player you deal them with a 0.65 second stun.

## Setup
Watch this video for a step by step guide on how to setup the tech aswell as new swords, shields, spears, and bows: 

## Modification
AMS has a "middleware" system that allows you to inject your own functionality in to aspects of the game. The gore, particles, sound effects, and stun system all utilize this system. To learn more about it, go into the Middleware section of this repository's wiki. The information there is a bit outdated, but it can give you an idea on how you may utilize the various middlewares in the codebase to add customization such as anti-team kill, breakable parts, safe-zones, etc.
