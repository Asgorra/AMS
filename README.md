## Why AET?

#### AET is unique
- Draw Combat (weapons can be drawn back to do higher damage)
- Directional Combat
- A custom Tool System, ToolBar GUI, and Health GUI.

#### AET contains many features...
- Swords, Spears, Javelins, Bows & Arrows, Shields, & more...

#### AET is build with modifiability in mind
- The tech is extremely customizable without any coding experience! Many of the features can be easily disabled with the switch of a variable.
- Configuring weapons and shields is super easy (no developing experience required) and has already been documented in a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBKqoC4-Vio
- It's the most moddable ancient era tech ever! The code is heavily documented and there are already tutorials on how you can easily add lots of fuctionality to the code without actually editing a single line of the main codebase: https://github.com/hatmatty/AET/wiki/Overview

#### AET is built with attracting new users in mind
- Mobile Compatible! This might not seem like a lot but when you consider that 79% of roblox user's use mobile you realize just how much users, activity, revenue, and more you are missing out by using other technologies that aren't mobile compatible!
- Simple to learn! All of the buttons that the tech uses are intuiative and are the most commonly used (WASD / Mouse) and require no tutorial or tooltip. In comparison to other ancient era techs, AET stands out. Almost every anicent era tech out there has the shield not on the toolbar. This is actually horrible user experience as new users would be unsure of what button to click to equip the shield! AET changes this by adding the shield into the toolbar through it's usage of a custom tool-system. This allows for users to easily notice the shield in the toolbar and not have to worry about not knowing some obscure button like "Q" to equip a shield.

*Hands down AET is the most configurable, developer-friendly, and user-friendly tech out there and we are striving to be even better!*
