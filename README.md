## Why Advabced Melee System?

#### AMS is unique
- Draw Combat (weapons can be drawn back to do higher damage)
- Directional Combat
- A custom Tool System, ToolBar GUI, and Health GUI.

#### AMS contains many features...
- Immersive Camera
- Sound Effects
- Particle Effects
- Swords, Spears, Bows & Arrows, Shields, & more...

#### AMS is build with modifiability in mind
- The tech is **extremely customizable** without any coding experience! Many of the features can be easily disabled with the switch of a variable.
- Configuring weapons and shields is super easy **(no developing experience required)** and has already been documented in a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBKqoC4-Vio
- It's the **most moddable ancient era tech ever!** The code is heavily documented and there are already tutorials on how you can easily add lots of fuctionality to the code without actually editing a single line of the main codebase: https://github.com/hatmatty/AET/wiki/Overview

#### AMS is built with attracting new users in mind
- **Mobile Compatible!** This might not seem like a lot but when you consider that 79% of roblox user's use mobile you realize just how much users, activity, revenue, and more you are missing out by using other technologies that aren't mobile compatible!
- **Simple to learn!** All of the buttons that the tech uses are intuitive and require no tutorial. In comparison to other ancient era techs, AET stands out. Almost every anicent era tech out there has the shield not on the toolbar. This is actually horrible user experience as new users would be unsure of what button to click to equip the shield! AET changes this by adding the shield into the toolbar through it's usage of a custom tool-system. This allows for users to not worry about knowing an obscure button such as "Q" to equip a shield.

#### AMS is built to eliminate toxicity!

- Ancient genre techs are themselves often a primary contributor to toxicity. For instance Lake tech, an exploitable tech in which there is an obscure tactic known as “angling” to get hits when your sword doesn’t touch the other player. This only causes toxicity as players don’t understand how they died and feel a begrudging feeling against their killer, being more likely to call them an exploiter and hold them in contempt. This extends to almost all ancient genre techs as they do not provide a clear way of understanding if a hit is fair or not. AET changes this by displaying it’s real-time ray tracing in a trail-like effect. If this effect touches a person then it should always hit, however if it isn’t touching then it should never hit! This simple feature decreases toxicity and increases sportsmanship as people see each other’s raycast trail and resort to improving themselves instead of skepticism.

*Hands down AET is the most configurable, developer-friendly, and user-friendly tech out there and we are striving to be even better!*
